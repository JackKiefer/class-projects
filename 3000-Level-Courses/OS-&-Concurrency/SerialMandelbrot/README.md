This program demonstrates an implementation of a class that generates square grayscale .ppm images of the Mandelbrot set.
The class accepts three lines of input from a input.txt:
- The width/length in pixels 
- A real lower limit
- An imaginary lower limit
- A real upper limit

For example, to generate a 800x800 image of the entire Mandelbrot set, then input.txt will look like:
800
-2.5
1.75
1.0
