This assignment involved taking our previous WordLadders assignment and replacing the linked list with an AVL tree. 
After doing so, the brute-force algorithm of the assignment was replaced with a much more efficient A-star algorithm.

The program itself runs various test cases of the two algorithms, comparing them against their respective work done and execution time.
