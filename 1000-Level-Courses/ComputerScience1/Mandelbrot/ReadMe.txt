This program generates grayscale .ppm images of the Mandelbrot set.
It accepts three lines of input from a file called mandelinput.txt:
- A real lower limit
- An imaginary lower limit
- A real upper limit

Image resolution can easily be adjusted by modifying the PIXEL_DIMENSIONS constant in the anonymous namespace.
