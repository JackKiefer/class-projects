This is a class written to represent rational numbers. Each rational number has two parts: a numerator and a denominator. The class supports:

- Casting from a rational to a float or double and from an integer to a rational
- Comparison operators: <, >, ==, <=, >=, !=
- Arithmetic operators: +, +=. *, *=, /, /=, -, -=
- I/O stream insertion and extraction: <<, >>

It also includes a main program (Main.cpp) that is a simple demonstration of the class's implementation.
